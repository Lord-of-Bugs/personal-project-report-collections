# personal-project-report-collections

This repo acts as a catalog and storage for my personal and course project reports. Below is a table of contents each with a brief overview for the reports. This table of contents will incrementally become largers as I organize the reports and files.

At each step, we reasoned our intuition as to why we are building our parameters and models the way we did. At the end, we evaluated each model holistically using different error metrics and selected one that performed best overall. We did not directly discuss the incorporation of our model into a functional recommendation system but it is our immediate next step of future works.	| "They have explored a decent number of papers and explained how well their implementations are." | 9/2022 | 12/2022 | A+ | [Yunfan Long](https://github.com/nobugguy) |
